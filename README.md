a.	ML Web Server Description:
The server will receive the image name and its parameter and that will be checked by the “model.h5”. The model further will predict if the image is rock, paper, scissor and based on the category it will respond back to the client and the message will display. 

b.	Testing:
To test the server, we can run the python server file “HW6.py” on the python interpreter and once we received the local host Ip address, we can use the postman client to test the server.

c.	Server can be started by using, “./server.sh”
